Before fitting a statistical model to a dataset, checking for outliers is paramount. Existence of outliers can negtively affect the accuracy of the model

Recall the following defintions:
Q1 = lower quartile
Q2 = Middle quartile = Median
Q3 = Upper quartile

IQR = Q3 - Q1

The Tukey fences identifies a possible outlier x as any data point that is:
below Q1 - 1.5*IQR or
above Q3 + 1.5*IQR

ggplot2 geom_boxplot function has this calculation included. Consider the mtcars dataset available in R.

Load Required Libraries
```{r Libraries}
library(tidyverse)
```

Consider the mtcars dataset
Data Structure
```{r Data}
glimpse(mtcars)
```

Draw a boxplot and highlight in red the possible outliers
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot(
    fill = "grey",
    outlier.colour = "red")
```
